# ðŸš© About Me
I'm currently a Ph.D. Student from [School of Computer Science](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Haihong E](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/ehaihong/zh_CN/index.htm). I will visit [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) as a joint Ph.D. Student in November 2024, supervised by [Asst. Prof. Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/). Before that, I received the bachelor degree at [School of Computer Science](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My research interest includes knowledge graph, large language model and their bi-directionally driven combination for interpretable representation learning and doman-specific applications, which can be devided as follow:
- Hierarchical Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph Schema Design
- LLM-based Knowledge Graph Construction
- LLM-based Semantic Parsing for Knowledge Base Question Answering
- Pretrained Model for Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph Embedding
- Complex Logical Query Answering over Knowledge Graphs
